*renamer.txt*	Mangle filenames like text

INTRODUCTION                                                  *renamer* {{{1
Show a list of file names in a directory, rename then in the vim buffer
using vim editing commands, then have vim rename them on disk.

DESCRIPTION                                       *renamer-description* {{{1
Renaming a single file is easily done via an operating system file explorer,
the vim file explorer (netrw.vim), or the command line.  When you want to
rename a bunch of files, especially when you want to do a common text
manipulation to those file names, this plugin may help.  It shows you all
the files in the current directory (and optionally in those below it),
and lets you edit their names in the vim buffer.  When you're ready,
issue the command |:Ren| to perform the mass rename, or check with |:RenTest|.
Relative paths can be given, and new directories will be created, with 755
permissions, as required.

USAGE                                                   *renamer-usage* {{{1
:Renamer {dir}                                          *:Renamer*
            Start renaming in {dir} (defaults to the |pwd|). Opens a new
            VimRenamer window.

The VimRenamer window contains a directory listing. You can modify
filenames and remove files.

:Ren or :w (see g:RenamerSupportColonWToRename) will apply your changes.
:RenTest will just show what will be moved (and which new directories will be
created).

Set the user configurable variables defined in plugin/renamer.vim as desired.

To start renaming in the current directory, you can define a map to
<Plug>RenamerStart: >
    nmap <Leader>r <Plug>RenamerStart
<

INSTALL DETAILS                                       *renamer-install* {{{1
The usual pathogen setup - add renamer directory to $HOME/.vim/bundle
directory.

INSTALLING TO WINDOWS XP/7/8 RIGHT CLICK MENU       *renamer-win-right-click*
You may use the included batch script "AddVimRenamerToContextMenu.bat"
to automatically add context menu entries. This script adds context menu
entries for folders AND FILES. The result is the same for both: open
vim-renamer with the target folder. I just added this for convenience.
You may delete the "add it for all file types" section, if you don't like
this. Plus feel free to modify the menuEntry string.

For reference: this is the old manual guide:

To add running this script on a directory as a right click menu option,
in Windows XP or 7, if you are confident working with the registry, do as
follows (NOTE - THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAME FROM THE WEB AND WORKED FOR
ME, BUT I CAN'T GUARANTEE THEY ARE 100% SAFE):
- Run the Registry Editor (REGEDIT.EXE).
- Open (My) Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory and click on the
  sub-item 'shell'.
- Select New from the Edit menu, and then select Key.
- Here, type VimRenamer and press Enter.
- Double-click on the (default) value in the right pane, and type the name
  to see in the menu, eg Rename Files with Vim Renamer, and press Enter.
- Highlight the new key in the left pane, select New from the Edit menu,
  and then select Key again.
- Type the word Command for the name of this new key, and press Enter.
- Double-click on the (default) value in the right pane, and type the full
  path and filename to vim, along with the command as per the following
  example line:
  "C:\Program Files\vim\vim74\gvim.exe" -c "cd %1|Renamer"
  Change the path as required, press Enter when done.
- Close the Registry Editor when finished.

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS                            *renamer-improvements* {{{1
- When starting renamer from an already running instance of vim, the cursor
  begins in the original files window if that is enabled.  The reason for
  this related to the fact that I couldn't get the window sizing to work
  when renamer was invoked directly from the command line unless the cursor
  stayed in the left window initially.  The way it is suits me, but if you
  can help fix the problem, let me know.
- Add different ways of sorting files, eg case insensitive, by date, size etc
- Rationalise the code so directories and files use the same arrays indexed
  by type of file.
- Refactor to make functions smaller
- Add installation instructions for Windows 7?  Or better still, upgrade
  my Windows 7 box to XP :)
- Make a suggestion!

CHANGELOG                                         *renamer-changelog*   {{{1
1.0 - initial functionality
1.1 - added options to
      a) support :w as substitute for :Ren, and
      b) ignore wildignore settings when reading in files
    - fixed highlighting after file deletion
    - various other minor changes, eg naming the buffer.
1.2 - fix filename handling for linux - thanks Antonio Monizio

      for the request that made it finally happen.
    - fix location of intermediate files to be the same as the source file.
      (Particularly important for large files on slow-access media, as
