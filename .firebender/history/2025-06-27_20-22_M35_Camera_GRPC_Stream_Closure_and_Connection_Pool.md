# M35 Camera GRPC Stream Closure and Connection Pool Exhaustion Risk (2025-06-27 20:41:15)

_**User**_

I want to understand better if @MonoCVGrpcUtils.kt  has a grpc connection pool limit

assuming i don't call close in the CV stream is there a chance the GRPC connection pool will exhaust if we keep trying to open again.

here are some relevant classes:
- @DashCamManagerImpl.kt 
- @DashCameraForM35.kt 

I Only care about the M3.5 camera

search the entire codebase if you need to. come up with a holistic complete answer

Based on my analysis of the codebase, here's a comprehensive answer about the gRPC connection pool limit in MonoCVGrpcUtils.kt:

## Analysis of gRPC Connection Pool Exhaustion Risk

### Current Implementation

1. **Single Channel Pattern**: MonoCVGrpcUtils uses a singleton pattern with an AtomicReference to maintain a single ManagedChannel instance. This means:
   - Only ONE gRPC channel is created and reused across all calls
   - The channel is lazily initialized on first use
   - The same channel instance is shared for all stub creations

2. **Channel Configuration** (from GrpcChannelUtils):
   - **Idle timeout**: 250 milliseconds - very short!
   - **Retry enabled**: Yes, with automatic retry for UNAUTHENTICATED status
   - **Keep-alive**: Not explicitly configured (using gRPC defaults)

### Connection Pool Analysis

**There is NO connection pool exhaustion risk** because:

1. **Single Channel**: MonoCVGrpcUtils creates only one ManagedChannel, not a pool. All gRPC stubs share this single channel.

2. **gRPC Internals**: A single ManagedChannel internally manages its own connection pooling and multiplexing. Multiple concurrent RPCs (including streams) can run over the same channel without exhausting resources.

3. **Stream Behavior**: The `getProduceCameraStream` returns a server-streaming RPC. Even if you don't close the stream properly:
   - The stream runs on the same shared channel
   - Multiple unclosed streams don't create new channels
   - They may consume memory and CPU but won't exhaust connections

### Potential Issues Without Proper Close

However, not closing the CV stream can cause:

1. **Resource Leaks**:
   - Unclosed streams continue consuming memory
   - Server-side resources remain allocated
   - Client-side coroutines keep running

2. **Retry Mechanism**: DashCameraForM35 has:
   - 3 retry attempts with 500ms delay
   - If streams aren't closed, retries create additional streams on the same channel
   - This compounds the resource leak issue

3. **Idle Timeout Impact**: The 250ms idle timeout is extremely short, which means:
   - The channel disconnects quickly when idle
   - Reconnection happens automatically on next use
   - This doesn't create new channels but may cause latency

### Current Flow for M3.5

1. DashCamManagerImpl creates DashCameraForM35
2. DashCameraForM35 opens DashCameraCvStream
3. DashCameraCvStream creates a stub using MonoCVGrpcUtils (single channel)
4. Stream collection starts with retry logic
5. On disconnect/error, the stream is retried up to 3 times
6. Close() properly shuts down the stream and calls MonoCVGrpcUtils.shutdown()

### Recommendations

While connection pool exhaustion isn't a risk, you should still ensure proper cleanup:
- Always call close() on DashCameraForM35 to stop the stream
- The current implementation properly calls MonoCVGrpcUtils.shutdown() which closes the channel
- Consider implementing a stream health check to detect stale streams
- The 250ms idle timeout might be too aggressive for streaming use cases

_**User**_

based on your analysis of @DashCameraForM35.kt  @DashCamManagerImpl.kt @DashCameraCvStream.kt  and @MonoCVGrpcUtils.kt - are there any issues with memory leak?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, there are several potential memory leak issues in this implementation:

## Memory Leak Issues Identified

### 1. **Stream Retry Without Cleanup**
In `DashCameraForM35.kt`, the retry mechanism doesn't properly clean up failed streams:

```kotlin
.retry(MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS) { ex ->
    Log.warn(TAG, "[DCS][DC] Basket stream collect error - retrying...", ex)
    delay(RETRY_DELAY)
    true  // Always returns true, retrying for any error
}
```

**Issue**: When the gRPC stream fails and retries, the old stream may not be properly cancelled server-side, leading to orphaned streams consuming resources.

### 2. **Infinite Retry Loop in DashCamManagerImpl**
The camera recording loop can create multiple camera instances without proper cleanup:

```kotlin
while (!isCameraConnected.value) {
    try {
        val camera = createCamera(retryCount)
        if (camera != null) {
            openCamera(camera) { frame -> dashCamMediaCaptureApi.addFrame(frame) }
        }
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        // Error logged but camera not cleaned up
    }
    retryCount++
    delay(RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS.seconds)
}
```

**Issue**: If `openCamera` fails after `createCamera` succeeds, the created camera instance is never closed, leaking resources.

### 3. **Channel Shutdown Race Condition**
In `MonoCVGrpcUtils.kt`:

```kotlin
fun shutdown() {
    channel.get()?.shutdown()?.awaitTermination(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
    channel.set(null)
}
```

**Issue**: If multiple threads call `createStub()` and `shutdown()` concurrently, there's a race condition where a new channel might be created after shutdown but before setting to null.

### 4. **Coroutine Scope Leak**
In `DashCameraForM35.kt`:

```kotlin
class DashCameraForM35(
    private val cameraScope: CoroutineScope = CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.IO)
)
```

**Issue**: Each `DashCameraForM35` instance creates its own CoroutineScope. If camera creation fails in the retry loop, these scopes are never cancelled, leaking coroutines.

### 5. **Missing Stream Cancellation**
The `frameCollectionJob` might not properly cancel the underlying gRPC stream:

```kotlin
frameCollectionJob?.cancel()  // Cancels the coroutine
cameraScope.coroutineContext.cancelChildren()  // Cancels children
```

**Issue**: Cancelling the coroutine doesn't guarantee the gRPC stream is properly closed server-side.

### 6. **Stub Reuse Issue**
In `DashCameraCvStream.kt`:

```kotlin
private var stub: MonocvGrpcKt.MonocvCoroutineStub? = null

fun open(): Boolean {
    if (stub == null) {
        stub = MonoCVGrpcUtils.createStub()
    }
    return true
}
```

**Issue**: The stub is cached but never cleared on failure. If the underlying channel is shutdown, the stub becomes invalid but remains cached.

## Recommendations

1. **Add proper cleanup in retry loop**:
```kotlin
// ... existing code ...
private var previousCamera: DashCamera? = null

while (!isCameraConnected.value) {
    try {
        previousCamera?.close()  // Clean up previous attempt
        val camera = createCamera(retryCount)
        // ... existing code ...
    }
}
```

2. **Fix the stub caching**:
```kotlin
fun close() {
    Log.info(TAG, "[DCS][CVS] close camera grpc stream")
    stub = null  // Clear the cached stub
    MonoCVGrpcUtils.shutdown()
}
```

3. **Add stream cancellation**:
```kotlin
private var currentStream: Flow<MonocvService.CameraFrame>? = null

fun getStream(): Flow<MonocvService.CameraFrame>? {
    // ... existing code ...
    currentStream = stub!!.getProduceCameraStream(Empty.getDefaultInstance())
    return currentStream
}

fun close() {
    // Cancel stream before shutting down
    currentStream = null
    stub = null
    MonoCVGrpcUtils.shutdown()
}
```

4. **Use shared scope instead of creating new ones**:
```kotlin
class DashCameraForM35(
    private val cameraScope: CoroutineScope  // Inject instead of creating
)
```

These memory leaks could accumulate over time, especially in scenarios where the camera connection is unstable and triggers frequent retries.

_**User**_

let's consider each of the problems 1 by 1. starting with the memory leak issue #1 you specified -  "the retry mechanism doesn't properly clean up failed streams"

does the .catch statement not take care of cleaning up the failed stream?

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right to question this. Let me analyze the flow more carefully:

## Analyzing the Retry/Catch Flow

Looking at the code structure in `DashCameraForM35.kt`:

```kotlin
cameraFrameFlow
    .retry(MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS) { ex ->
        Log.warn(TAG, "[DCS][DC] Basket stream collect error - retrying...", ex)
        delay(RETRY_DELAY)
        true
    }
    .catch { ex ->
        Log.error(TAG, "[DCS][DC] Max retries exceeded", ex)
        disconnectCamera(onDisconnect)
    }
    .collect { frame ->
        runCatching { processFrame(frame) }
            .onFailure { e ->
                Log.warn(TAG, "[DCS][DC] Failed to process frame: ${e.message}")
            }
    }
```

## The Good News

The `.catch` block DOES call `disconnectCamera()`, which in turn calls:
- `basketCamera.close()` 
- Which calls `MonoCVGrpcUtils.shutdown()`
- Which properly shuts down the gRPC channel

## The Real Issue

However, there's still a potential memory leak during the retry phase:

1. **During Retries**: When `.retry()` encounters an error, it:
   - Logs the error
   - Delays 500ms
   - **Automatically resubscribes to the same Flow**
   
2. **The Problem**: The gRPC streaming RPC (`getProduceCameraStream`) creates a new server-side stream on each subscription. During retries:
   - The failed stream might not be properly cancelled on the server
   - The client immediately creates a new stream
   - This happens up to 3 times before the `.catch` block executes

3. **gRPC Behavior**: Server-streaming RPCs in gRPC don't automatically clean up when the client disconnects unexpectedly. The server might continue sending frames to a dead stream until it detects the disconnection (which can take time).

## Verdict

You're partially correct - the `.catch` block does clean up after all retries are exhausted. However, **Memory Leak Issue #1 is still valid** because:

- During the retry attempts (not after), failed streams may not be immediately cleaned up server-side
- Each retry creates a new stream without explicitly cancelling the previous one
- This can temporarily leak resources during the retry window

The leak is **temporary** (lasting until the server detects disconnection) rather than permanent, but it's still a resource management issue that could be improved by explicitly cancelling the stream before retrying.

You're right, the manual retry loop is clunky. Here's a more elegant solution using Kotlin Flow operators properly:

Wait, I need to check if we need to handle the stream recreation differently since `retryWhen` operates on the same Flow. Let me create a better solution:
