# Tasks

The key to my productivity is knowing which tasks take 5 minutes or less. If i know it's more than 5 minutes throw it in a list and then prioritize it right away.

[[;Things]]
[[;Inbox]]



### ⏫ Important & Urgent
```tasks
not done
priority is above none
happens before in 7 days
starts before tomorrow
hide created date
hide edit button
```

### (Over) Due
```tasks
not done
due before tomorrow
sort by priority
hide created date
hide edit button
```


# [[Goals#2023]]
```tasks
not done
tags include #goal
sort by priority
happens before in 3 days
hide created date
hide edit button
```


## Done

```tasks
done on <% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD") %>
path does not include <% tp.file.title %>
```
