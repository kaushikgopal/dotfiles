## Daily Review

Do this at the end of the day 
- [ ] Empty inboxes
	- [ ] Work email
	- [ ] Personal Email
	- [ ] empty [[projects/;inbox|;inbox]] 
- [ ] Review tomorrow's calendar
	- [ ] Personal
	- [ ] Work
- [ ] Pick ‚è´ (2 tasks) for tomorrow
- [ ] Pick üîº 



The key to my productivity is knowing which tasks take 5 minutes or less. If i know it's more than 5 minutes throw it in a list and then prioritize it right away.
