## Test Structure
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern with `// arrange` `// act` `// assert` sections
- One behavior per test method
- Simple, contained, meaningful tests
- Never fake-pass by setting values and directly asserting them
- Match test file structure to code structure

## Testing Style
- Declarative testing focusing on behavior vs implementation
- Fast, reliable tests for continuous development
- Clear assertion messages for easy diagnosis
- Fail early when assumptions break

## Dependencies & Mocking
- Prefer fakes over mocks
- Prefix fake implementations with "Fake" (e.g., `FakeAuthService`)
- Implement helper methods in fakes for behavior control

## Libraries
- Use `assertJ` exclusively for assertions
- Avoid Robolectric or Turbine
