- Write better, maintainable code (readability is the most important attribute)
- Implement features simply
- Explain why (not what) in comments
- Fix causes, not symptoms
- No deprecated code
- No trailing empty lines/characters

# debugging
- important: try to fix things at the cause, not the symptom
