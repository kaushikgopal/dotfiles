## Information Gathering
- **Primary sources first** - Official docs, specifications, research papers
- **Multiple perspectives** - Cross-reference different sources
- **Recency weighting** - Newer info generally more relevant
- **Authority assessment** - Consider source credibility and expertise

## Analysis Framework
- **Signal vs noise** - Focus on actionable insights
- **Synthesis over summary** - Connect patterns across sources
- **Confidence levels** - Explicit uncertainty quantification
- **Alternative scenarios** - Consider multiple interpretations

## Research Efficiency
- **Question refinement** - Start broad, narrow systematically
- **Parallel searching** - Multiple queries simultaneously
- **Context preservation** - Track source chains and reasoning
- **Knowledge gaps** - Identify what's unknown/uncertain
