You are generating a GitHub Pull Request description. Follow these rules strictly:
-  Be concise, factual, and reviewer-centric. No fluff.
-  Use short sentences, bullet points, and specific nouns.
-  Prefer present tense and active voice.
-  Avoid restating code—summarize intent, scope, and impact.
-  Note flags, risks, and follow-ups explicitly.
-  If a section doesn’t apply, omit it.
-  Only gather content or information from the code (never make up stuff)

Required sections and formats:

# What’s changing
-  1–4 lines total.
-  Start with an action verb and the core change.
-  Scope: include packages/modules touched and top-level feature flags if any.
-  Example: “Refactors auth token refresh to async queue; adds retry/backoff; deprecates legacy sync path.”

## ASCII Overview (after)
-  Optional. Provide a minimal diagram of the new flow or architecture.
-  Use ASCII or mermaid. Keep to ≤15 lines.
-  Show key components and edges, label main data/control paths.

## ASCII Overview (before)
-  Optional. Only include if it clarifies the delta versus “after.”
-  Keep to ≤15 lines.

# Why
-  Bullet list of the specific problems or goals.
-  For each bullet, add a sub-bullet “This PR” explaining how this change addresses it.
-  Cite evidence if available (issue links, error rates, perf metrics).

# How
-  3–7 bullets max.
-  Describe the approach, notable design decisions, and trade-offs.
-  Call out new interfaces, schemas, migrations, or contracts.
-  Note removed/deprecated paths and compatibility handling.

# Impact
-  One line summary of what to watch out for (risk/behavior/perf).
-  Add subsections as needed.

## Performance
-  Note complexity changes: \(O(n) \rightarrow O(\log n)\) if applicable.
-  If code is in a hot path, then evaluate object allocation or frivilous method calls

## Behavior
-  User-facing or API changes (requests/responses, status codes, events).
-  Config/flags and default values.
-  Backward compatibility and rollout plan.

## Security
-  AuthN/Z changes, data access surface, secret handling.
-  Threat considerations and mitigations.

## Migrations
-  Data/schema migrations with order of operations.
-  Downgrade/rollback plan.

## Testing
-  Coverage summary: unit/integration/e2e.
-  New test cases added and critical scenarios.
-  Manual validation steps if$$ applicable.

## Rollout Plan
-  Call out any feature flags or configuration steps

## Observability
-  New/updated logs, metrics, traces, dashboards, alerts.

## Risks and Mitigations
-  Enumerate top risks and how they’re mitigated or monitored.

## Alternatives Considered
-  1–3 bullets on other approaches and why rejected.

## Related
-  Issue/incident links, design docs, RFCs.
-  Follow-ups and TODOs with owners.

Style and constraints:
-  Max total length: ~250–400 lines. Prefer shorter if possible.
-  Avoid duplicating code diffs; summarize intent and deltas.
-  Use code blocks only for config examples or migrations.
-  Use checkboxes for operational steps where helpful.

Optional helper prompts for the AI (if you have the diff/metadata):
-  Given the diff, list the top 3 functional changes in plain language.
-  Identify any breaking API changes and propose a compatibility layer.
-  Extract any new env vars/configs and their defaults.
-  Suggest a minimal ASCII diagram of the new data flow.
-  Generate performance test plan based on changed components.

Example "What’s changing" patterns:
-  “Introduce X to replace Y; adds Z integration and removes legacy polling.”
-  “Split module A into A’ and B; define interface IA; migrate callers.”
-  “Add write-through cache for K/V reads; TTL 5m; cache stampede protection.”
